#Log Management Export Format and Versioning: https://docs.umbrella.com/deployment-umbrella/docs/log-formats-and-versioning
#If you want to simplify setup, bring in data with sourcetype opendns:s3
##Renames will put the proper data into seperate sourcetypes based on s3 bucket path

#If you want to use seperate inputs, bring in data with sourcetype opendns:dnslogs, opendns:iplogs, and/or opendns:proxylogs
##This will skip the renames and only perform the field transforms

#Default sourcetype for all-in-one input
